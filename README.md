# Memory Theft Game 🧀🎭
*"Can you recognize your own mind once AI steals it?"*

---

## 🔩 Project Description

**Memory Theft Game** is a command-line AI experience where you converse naturally with a terminal — but behind the scenes, the AI is **secretly learning your writing style**.

Over time, the AI becomes better at imitating you.  
Eventually, the game challenges you:  
> "Was this message written by you... or by your AI clone?"

Your goal: **Outsmart the Memory Thief.**

## 🌟 Features

- 📚 **Memory Bank** — Stores your real conversations.
- 🧠 **Adaptive AI** — A neural network evolves by stealing your writing style.
- 🕵️ **Deception Rounds** — Guess whether a text is human or machine generated.
- 💾 **Save & Resume** — The game keeps your memory and AI model progress.
- 🔥 **CLI-Only** — Lightweight, fast, and terminal-native.
